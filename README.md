# Personal AI OS

An AI Meta Operating System, which monitors your data, gives suggestions based on data, and builds automations based on suggestions.

## Core Philosophy

- Completely Offline, but still intelligent.

- Autonomous, but predictable.

## Architecture

Sentinel works in three stages, each with modular subsystems:

### Observe

Track how you spend time across your computer.

- **App Monitor** – Tracks your app activity

- **Browser Monitor** – Tracks your web activity

- **Github Monitor** – Tracks you code activity

- **Input Monitor** – Tracks your peripheral activity

### Reflect

Suggest ways to improve routine, personal and professional life along with productivity insights.

- **Routine Suggestions** – Suggestions on things you do often with a hidden or visible pattern.

- **Professional Suggestions** – Suggestions on improving professional life.

- **Productivity Suggestions** – Suggestions on improving your productivity.

- **Personal Suggestions** – Suggestions on improving your personal life.

### Act

Build automations to improve personal, professional life and improve productivity by automating routines.

- **Suggestion-based automation** - Built by LLM automatically based on the suggestions.

- **Manual automation** - Built by user manually.

Built by someone who just wanted to understand himself, and got carried away by building an AI OS instead. No cap.
